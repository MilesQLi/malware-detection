Experiments in malware detection and classification using machine learning techniques.

## 1. Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge
!["File Entropy Graph"](https://github.com/dchad/malware-detection/blob/master/resources/file-entropy-by-class.png "File Entropy by File Size")
Shannon's Entropy by file size. A score of 0.0 means the bytes are all the same value, a score of 1.0 means every byte in the file has a different value.
