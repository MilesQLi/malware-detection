Experiments in malware detection and classification using machine learning techniques.

## 1. Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge
### 1.1 Feature Engineering
    Initial feature engineering consisited of extracting various keyword counts from the ASM files and the entropy and file size from the BYTE files
    of the 10868 malware samples in the training set. Following further study of the research literature, image files of the first 1000 bytes of 
    the ASM and BYTE files were created and combined with keyword and entropy data. This resulted in a set of 2018 features.
### 1.2 Feature Reduction
    Statistical analysis of the feature set indicated that many of the features and low standard deviation and mean variance, making them unsuitable
    for learning. Therefore, two reduced features sets were created based on the 10% and 20% of features with the largest variance.
    Testing with an ExtraTreesClassifier and 10-fold cross validation produced the following results:
    - Original Keyword Counts: logloss = 0.034
    - 10% Highest Variance with Entropy and Image Features: logloss = 0.0174
    - 20% Highest Variance with Entropy and Image Features: logloss = 0.0164
### 1.3 Model Selection
    TODO:
!["File Entropy Graph 1"](https://github.com/dchad/malware-detection/blob/master/resources/file-entropy-by-class.png "File Entropy by Malware Class")
Shannon's Entropy by malware class. A score of 0.0 means the bytes are all the same value, a score of 1.0 means every byte in the file has a different value.
!["File Entropy Graph 2"](https://github.com/dchad/malware-detection/blob/master/resources/file-entropy-by-size.png "File Entropy by File Size")
Shannon's Entropy by file size. A score of 0.0 means the bytes are all the same value, a score of 1.0 means every byte in the file has a different value.
!["ASM Registry Counts"](https://github.com/dchad/malware-detection/blob/master/resources/register-counts.png "EDX by ESI Registry Counts")
Assembler register EDX by ESI counts.
